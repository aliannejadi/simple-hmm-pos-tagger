Simple HMM POS Tagger:

This is a very simple Python implementation of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Part Of Speech (POS) tagger.
Since there is no hidden variables in this problem, an HMM model is simply trained using Maximum Likelihood criteria.

How to Run:

To run the tagger type this in the command line:
    sudo chmod +x run
    ./run

This simple script trains and tests the POS tagger on Brown corpus and the result is stored in 'prediction.pos' file.
